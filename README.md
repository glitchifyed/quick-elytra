# Quick Elytra
Quick Elytra adds 'Quality of Life' changes such as adding keybinds that swap items in your inventory.

## Features
* A keybind that lets you swap your equipped elytra/chestplate. (v1.0.0)
\
It prioritises equipment with the most enchantments/enchantment levels and durability.
\
The default keybind is 'G' but it can easily be changed in the keybind control settings.
* A keybind that puts a Totem of Undying in your offhand if you don't already have one equipped. (v2.0.0)
\
The default keybind is 'X' but it can easily be changed in the keybind control settings.
* Auto replant crops that are mined by a hoe. Use the config in the mod menu to change its functionality. (v3.0.0)
\
This is untested on multiplayer servers so use at your own risk.
